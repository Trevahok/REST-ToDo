# REST-ToDo App 
  The django REST framework backend for the ReactJS rendered frontend hosted on Heroku.

### Tech Stack
- Django
- REST framework
- Axios
- ReactJS
- Bootstrap 4 
- Bootswatch darkly theme
- Heroku deployment

### Description
   The Django REST framework generated API, which is consumed by ReactJS using axios. The backend has provisions for: 
   - Date and time for deadline
   - Task title
   - Task description
   - User-specific list
   - Users list
   
( hahaha, front-end does only the title... JS sucks, so does my motivation to complete it. )
